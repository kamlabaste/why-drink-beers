                5 of the benefits of drinking beers:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beer is more nutritious than other alcoholic drinks:</strong> We hear a lot about the
                    abundance
                    of antioxidants in wine, but beer has just as many. The specific antioxidants are different because
                    the
                    flavonoids in barley and hops are different from those in grapes, but antioxidants are a good thing.
                    Beer is also higher than wine in protein and vitamin B. Even better, beer contains iron, calcium,
                    phosphates and even fiber </li>
                <li><strong>Beer can help protect your heart:</strong> Studies suggest moderate beer drinking* may make
                    you
                    less likely than those who don't drink to suffer from hearts attacks, strokes or heart disease. In
                    fact,
                    studies evaluating the relative benefits of wine versus beer versus spirits suggest that moderate
                    consumption of any alcoholic beverage is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Beer helps prevent kidney stones:</strong> Drinking beer could help reduce your risk of
                    developing kidney stones. According to a recent study, men and women who reported drinking a
                    moderate
                    amount* of beer reduced their risk of developing a stone by 41 percent. Beers that contain a lot of
                    hops
                    -- for example, pale ales -- are rich in kidney health-promoting phytochemicals. Clinical Journal of
                    the
                    American Society of Nephrology</li>
                <li><strong>Beer lowers bad cholesterol:</strong> The soluble fiber in beer can help reduce your LDL or
                    “bad” cholesterol. Increasing your intake of soluble fiber has numerous health benefits, including
                    the
                    promotion of healthy blood-sugar and blood-cholesterol levels. However, because alcohol interferes
                    with
                    the body's ability to absorb vitamins and minerals, it can also lessen the body's ability to burn
                    stored
                    fat. American Heart Association: Circulation</li>
                <li><strong>Beer strengthens your bones:</strong> Due to its high silicon content, beer may help to
                    build
                    stronger bones. Dietary silicon in the soluble form of orthosilicic acid (OSA) may be important for
                    the
                    growth and development of bone and connective tissue and help reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a
                    bone-thinning disease. National Institutes of Health</li>
